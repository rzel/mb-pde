Our software is currently able to detect 22 design patterns from the original 23 GoF pattern. We are not considering Fa√ßade since it is an architectural pattern and not a software design pattern. We can not define a specific static and dynamic structure that would allow us to detect this pattern. The following table shows our test results. We compared our tool with PINOT and FUJABA. For testing we used the GoF pattern implementation from the Applied Java Pattern book.
